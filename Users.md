#summary MogileFS users

# Introduction #

A list of some of the many current users of MogileFS.

# Details #

## SixApart ##

(Note: SixApart is now SayMedia)

SixApart stores and serves all user uploaded images, videos, and music via MogileFS. It has been a long term scalable data store for files varying from a few kilobytes to many megabytes. SixApart typically uses larger storage nodes (10+ drives) on dedicated hardware.

Normally files are served directly from storage nodes to clients. Gallery thumbnails are generated on the fly and displayed to clients, then "cached" in mogilefs with a single path. Thumbnails which disappear are simply regenerated again.

## YellowBot ##

[YellowBot](http://www.yellowbot.com/) and [weblocal.ca](http://www.weblocal.ca/) since early 2009.  We replaced our previous storage in Amazon S3 to get more control over the namespaces, headers on delivery and to improve performance.  We're storing user and business-owner pictures, videos and PDFs.  We're also using MogileFS for storing application log files (which are then used for analytics in a mapreduce-ish fashion).

As per November 2009 it's about 2TB across 30 million files from a few KB to 1GB in size.   The files are split in two installations; each have two trackers and respectively 6 and 4 storage nodes.

The trackers and storage nodes are just whatever servers have some spare CPU or disks respectively. A small Perl web server parses requests and returns the response and reproxy headers to Perlbal.  The databases are in our regular replicated database setup; we use a CDN for end-user delivery so the load is very minimal.

## Wikispaces ##

[Wikispaces](http://www.wikispaces.com/) has been using MogileFS since February 2006.  The system stores all user-generated content -- wiki pages, images, files -- ranging from a few bytes to several GB per file.  As of November 2009, we have four trackers backed by a multi-master MySQL database, ~100M files, tens of TB of storage on both small (4 disk) and large (10 disk) storage nodes.  We use lighttpd to serve files from mogstored nodes and nginx reproxying.

## Dreamwidth Studios ##

[dreamwidth.org Dreamwidth Studios]

  * Using MogileFS since: April 6th, 2008 (when we initially setup the development environments)
  * 7 hosts 14 devices (~200G each)
  * ~340,000 files
  * 2 trackers
  * Quad core Q6600 2.4GHz 4GB RAM dual ~200GB drives (NO RAID)

The machines do other things -- we "stripe" our MogileFS installation across the cluster of web servers, job servers, etc...

## Mecanto.com ##

Company name: Hyrax Media.

Company site: http://mecanto.com

Using mogile since: Day one (early 2008). After some research this seemed like the fastest way to get what we needed and also cheap in the long run.

Cluster size: Don't want to supply details but we store well over 100TB on it.

Rough number of files stored: Over 5 million

Number of trackers: 1 (I know this seems very little), our system currently manages with this, although I'm sure we should add more.

## Footnote.com ##

[Footnote](http://www.footnote.com) has been using mogile since Sept 2008. We have 200TB of storage and 200+ million files. We run lots of 2U supermicro 12 drive servers as dedicated mogile storage servers including some on ZFS. We use nginx for all get/puts. All mogile boxes are dedicated machines. Mogile is great! The best part about mogile is the way the drive lights flicker due to the non-raid random access of the disks. It looks like the racks are thinking.

## Rentalia Holidays ##

[Rentalia Holidays](http://www.rentalia.com)

Using mogile since July 2009.

Rentalia.com is an independent company created by a team of tourism and Internet experts.  Our aim is to make the search for a holiday rental as easy as possible.

## KWICK! Community ##

We use MogileFS since the start of 2011 for our main image store at
KWICK! Community (http://www.kwick.de). We are one of the big Social
Networks in Germany and over 10 years on the market.

All profile pictures and photo galleries are stored in MogileFS.

Numbers:
  * Over 80 Mio of image files
  * 2 Trackers (2 x E5520 2.27GHz, 12 GB RAM)
  * 7 dedicated storage nodes (8 x 15k SAS HDDs)
  * 24 shared storage nodes (mostly 3-4 x 7k SATA HDDs)
  * 123 MogileFS devices, total of 64TB storage available
  * 4 load balanced Nginx MogileFS Frontend servers
  * 2 MySQL Servers with SSD RAID and 48 GB RAM (one is Hot-Standby)
  * PHP MogileFS Extension is used by the application
  * Storage nodes use nginx too
  * Images smaller than 1 MB are cached via srcache + memc nginx module
in memcache (dedicated storage nodes are also Memcache servers)

Other fun facts:

  * All hardware is dedicated to Mogile.
  * We use nginx + [mogilefs module](http://www.grid.net.ru/nginx/mogilefs.en.html)
  * We cache all files upstream of Mogile and use memcached-based path caching on the trackers
  * Adding about 6 nodes every 45 days to keep up with current growth
  * Hope to get to 1 billion files and beyond!
